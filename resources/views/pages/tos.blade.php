                    <h2>Private Key Expiration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Upon successful verification of a vanity name purchase, Lumanaries.org shall maintain a recoverable
                        private key for a period of no more than 24 hours from the time of verification.

                        Lumanaries.org cannot restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys which are
                        not within Lumanaries.org's control. You acknowledge that Lumanaries.org is not responsible for
                        transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining private keys and/or Digital Currency associated
                        with any private key purchased on Lumanaries.org. If you and/or co-signing authorities lose, mishandle, or have stolen associated
                        Digital Currency private keys, or if your cosigners refuse to provide requisite authority, you
                        acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated Digital Currency, and that Lumanaries.org
                        is not responsible for such loss.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Operation of Digital Currency Protocols</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lumanaries.org does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the
                        operation of Digital Currency public/private keypairs supported on our platform. In general,
                        the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute
                        them. By using the Lumanaries.org platform, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Lumanaries.org
                        is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that Lumanaries.org makes
                        no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying
                        protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such
                        forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the encryption mechanism of
                        the Digital Currency you store in the Lumanaries.org platform. In the event of a fork,
                        you agree that Lumanaries.org may temporarily suspend Lumanaries.org operations (with or
                        without advance notice to you) and that Lumanaries.org may, in its sole discretion, decide
                        whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely.
                        You acknowledge and agree that Lumanaries.org assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever
                        in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Risk of Loss</h2>
                    <p>
                        All items purchased from Lumanaries.org are made pursuant to a digital shipment contract.
                        This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you
                        upon our delivery of the private key.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Third Party Payments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lumanaries.org has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality
                        or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Electronic Communications</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you visit Lumanaries.org or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically.

                        that such communications be in writing.
